### About Me
My name is Innocent Victor Mark and I’m from Nigeria, West Africa. I developed interest in Computer Science after I finished my Secondary School (High School). I applied to learn basic Computer Knowledge from a Cyber Café after which I applied to work for them for a while. Fortunately, I was given to role to assist the teacher. I taught basic introduction to computer, MS Word and MS Excel for a while. Over this period my interest  for Computer Sceince soared. I’ve learned some basic thing in HTML and CSS from these guys but I’ve always wanted to know more. I believe studying with Tech Expert Academy will make this dream a reality for me.
